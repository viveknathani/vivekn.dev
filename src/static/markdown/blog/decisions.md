# decisions

March 2024

Good decision making is about minimising regrets. In this blog, I am drafting some pointers for myself to live by. This mainly applies to the kind of decisions where a clear choice isn’t obvious.

1. Gather enough information about all the choices.
2. Compare the choices in all ways possible.
3. Draw the tree of outcomes.
4. Does a choice really matter here? Am I in a position to do the other thing if this thing does not work out?
5. Which choice helps me get closer to the person I want to be?
6. Which choice aligns the most to my personal values?
7. Are you deciding too early and trying to avoid conflicting thoughts? Is it possible that the date to make the decision is still far away into the future?
8. Can I ask for an opinion of someone who understands my situation?
9. Be true to yourself.
