    <h1>hi, I am Vivek</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer based in India. I am particularly interested in
      math, computers, and history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I write blogs. You can find them over <a href="/blog">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently working at
      <a href="https://www.marscomputers.tech/">Mars Computers</a> where we are
      trying to make powerful compute accessible everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this, I used to build and maintain backend systems at
      <a href="https://www.investmint.club/">Investmint</a>. Here's a brief list
      of interesting things I had built in my time here so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        inves-broker - A heavily used internal library written in Node.js for
        interacting with multiple broker APIs in the Indian stock market.
      </li>
      <li>
        news feed - This is a real-time, AI powered news feed that sends the
        latest updates for all the companies who have their stocks listed on
        <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/">NSE</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        portfolio import and analysis - You can import your holdings from 10+
        brokers in India and get detailed analysis on top of it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I love hacking on side projects.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app">teachyourselfmath</a> - a free
        website with an evergrowing list of math problems, parsed by an engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/mymathboard">mymathboard</a> -
        a tool for visualzing graphs and running calculations, written as a
        native desktop app in Rust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/workdiff">workdiff</a> -
        generate changelogs from commits and send them to slack, on a
        daily/weekly/monthly basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://nattukaka.dev/">nattukaka</a> - home for all my server
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>also</h3>
    <p>
      I love math, <a href="/databases">databases</a>, and
      <a href="/history">history</a>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>misc</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>People over companies, kindness over smartness.</li>
      <li>Most of us suck at time estimation.</li>
      <li>
        Sometimes, choosing the path less traveled has a higher upside. You can
        eliminate competition by making the right choices.
      </li>
    </ul>
