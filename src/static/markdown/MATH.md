# math

I love this subject but I see a pain point in problems being scattered across multiple textbooks. I wished for a simple website with a large list of math problems, parsed from multiple textbooks, and sorted by difficulty. And that's how [teachyourselfmath](https://teachyourselfmath.app/) was born.

I got interested in number theory. Spent a good chunk of time (October 2024 - March 2025) working through the book [Elementary Number Theory by David M Burton](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Number-Theory-David-Burton/dp/0073051888). I think I am gonna stay interested in this topic for a while.

I also started a math club - [teachyourselfmath.app/club](https://teachyourselfmath.app/club).

For about a month, I spent time learning linear algebra. I watched some lectures by Gilbert Strang, also watched 3b1b's Essence Of Linear Algebra playlist. I just got bored. Despite the great efforts of the creators, I just couldn't get into it. Maybe, I'll give it another shot in the future.
