# future as of 2204

<i>Starting this year, I am trying to do a series of posts of predicting the future of the areas that I am interested in. I will be writing one such post every year. I am excited to see how right or how wrong I am going to be.</i>

1. The consumer credit bubble in India will burst.
2. We will be able to compress better than ever. The next hutter prize winner will be a leapfrog in this space.
3. [pixxel.space](https://www.pixxel.space/) will be a pretty big deal in space tech from India. 
4. We will see personalized learning startups that use AI. 
5. Commerically viable robotic maids will be a realistic thing.
6. Hiring juniors in tech will become more competitive.
7. iPhones will become a very common thing in India. 
8. AI will be more open sourced than a closed one. 
9. Google will see a death in most of its products, except search.
10. We will be able to create movies from our minds and experiences. (Thought -> Text -> Prompt -> Video & Audio)
