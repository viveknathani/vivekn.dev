1. keep your house in order. when your house is not in order, nothing will go right. make time for it and fix it.
2. time moves slowly if you are careful. do the right things. put yourself under good pressure. produce great things.
3. if you cannot speak good about somebody, do not speak about them at all. you will end up being misunderstood.
