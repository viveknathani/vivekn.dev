# future as of 2024

March 2024

<i>Starting this year, I am trying to do a series of posts of predicting the future of the areas that I am interested in. I will be writing one such post every year. I am excited to see how right or how wrong I am going to be.</i>

1. We will be able to compress better than ever. The next hutter prize winner will be a leapfrog in this space.
2. [pixxel.space](https://www.pixxel.space/) will be a pretty big deal in space tech from India.
3. We will see personalized learning startups that use AI.
4. Commerically viable robotic maids will be a realistic thing.
5. Hiring juniors in tech will become more competitive.
6. iPhones will become a very common thing in India.
7. AI will be more open sourced than a closed one.
8. We will be able to create movies from our minds and experiences. (Thought -> Text -> Prompt -> Video & Audio)
