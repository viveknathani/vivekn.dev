    <h1>hi, I am Vivek</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer based in India. I am particularly interested in
      math, databases, religion, and history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I write blogs. You can find them over <a href="/blog">here</a>.

    <h3>work</h3>
    <p>
      I build and maintain backend systems at
      <a href="https://www.investmint.club/">Investmint</a>. Here's a brief list
      of interesting things I have built in my time here so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        inves-broker - A heavily used internal library written in Node.js for
        interacting with multiple broker APIs in the Indian stock market.
      </li>
      <li>
        news feed - This is a real-time, AI powered news feed that sends the
        latest updates for all the companies who have their stocks listed on
        <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/">NSE</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        portfolio import and analysis - You can import your holdings from 10+
        brokers in India and get detailed analysis on top of it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a side project, I have been working on
      <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app/">teachyourselfmath</a> - a free
      website with an evergrowing list of math problems, parsed by a home grown
      engine (posted on
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39113879">Hacker News</a>).
      I believe technology is an accelerator for making education accessible.
      With the right intentions and decent capital at disposal, we can truly
      make a dent in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And before all of this, I was studying engineering and making fun little
      CLIs and servers like -
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/retain">retain</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/binge">binge</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/trackbit">trackbit</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/maketest">maketest</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/assignexpert/assignexpert">assignexpert</a>.

    <h3>reading and culture</h3>
    <p>
      It has been a journey of self discovery for me to arrive at what I find
      interesting to read. I am genuinely interested in religion and history,
      along with computing being the primary candidate. I describe more on this
      over <a href="./lists"> here</a>.

    <h3>misc</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>People over companies, kindness over smartness.</li>
      <li>Most of us suck at time estimation.</li>
      <li>
        Sometimes, choosing the path less traveled has a higher upside. You can
        eliminate competition by making the right choices.
      </li>
    </ul>
