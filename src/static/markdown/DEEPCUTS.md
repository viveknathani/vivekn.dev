# deepcuts

This page is a list of books, papers, and videos that I think are truly great. There is no central theme here. I list whatever I like.


<i>The Shiva Trilogy by Amish Tripathi</i> - This book series had a major impact on my mind. I was on the verge of transitioning from a long time atheist to a theist, and a fictional introduction to the mythology of lord shiva made me develop deep interest in him.

<i>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky</i> - Dostoevsky was an artist in narrating a case study on morality and inner conflict. It's deeply layered and deserves a re-read sometime again in the future! My favorite part is the slowly developing relationship between Sonia and Raskolnikov. It shows that no matter how weird you are, you will find acceptance and love in this world.

<i>MIT's videos on [how to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare) and [how to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&ab_channel=UChicagoSocialSciences)</i> - Taught by two incredible professors. Worth re-watching.

<i>What every programmer should know about memory</i> - A classic [paper](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf) by Ulrich Drepper. This does not need a description. Just read it.

<i>The Godfather Trilogy</i> - Put it on TV, get some whiskey, sit back, and enjoy pure art.

<i>Chip War - the race for semiconductor supremacy</i> - A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mvWbKEpO9Q&ab_channel=TaiwanPlusDocs) on the importance of semiconductors in the modern world.
