# slow money - hard learnings from startups, markets, and life

As of today, I’m three years into my career. I’ve lived the fast-paced Bangalore startup life - the kind you’d hear about in every typical story. I’ve witnessed a 0 -> 1 journey as an early employee, co-founded a startup, and now I’m working at what the cool kids call “scale.” The thing about life is: while you are busy working on what you presume to be the most important thing, life itself doesn’t wait. The same holds true for financial markets. 

## speed is necessary
As a default in life, move fast. Slowness in one place bleeds into everything else. Ship fast, talk to users quickly, keep iterating. Nobody likes working with slow people. Commit to timelines and get shit done. Build a reputation for finishing things, no matter the outcome.
