# math

I love this subject but I see a pain point in problems being scattered across multiple textbooks. I wished for a simple website with a large list of math problems, parsed from multiple textbooks, and sorted by difficulty. And that's how [teachyourselfmath](https://teachyourselfmath.app/) was born.

Lately, I have been learning a lot about number theory. I am currently working through the book [Elementary Number Theory by David M Burton](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Number-Theory-David-Burton/dp/0073051888). There are a few more things around this topic that I have planned for myself in the coming months and I will update this page as I progress.
