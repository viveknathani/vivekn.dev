    <h1>hi, I am Vivek</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>I’m an engineer from India who loves creating things.</p>

    <p>
      I currently take care of engineering at
      <a href="https://www.marscomputers.tech/">Mars Computers</a>, where where
      we build powerful remote machines that feel local. Alongside that, I work
      with early-stage startups as a consultant, helping them architect backend
      systems, implement APIs, and navigate deep problems in their cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve always been curious about how systems are built. A networking issue
      once led me down the rabbit hole of understanding DNS. A bottleneck in my
      database sparked my interest in database internals. I find joy in digging
      deep. There’s nothing quite as rewarding as understanding how systems
      work, building something beautiful around that understanding, and seeing
      real users benefit from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of software, I’m also a math enthusiast. These days, I run a
      <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app/club">math club</a> in Bengaluru,
      India.
    </p>

    <p>Sporadically, I write <a href="/blog">blogs</a>.</p>

    <p>
      If you’re looking for inspiration, check out my
      <a href="/deepcuts">deepcuts</a> section—it’s where I share books, papers,
      and videos that I think are truly worth your time.
