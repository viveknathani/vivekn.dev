# future as of 2025

January 2025

<i>Since [2024](/blog/future-2024), I am trying to do a series of posts of predicting the future of the areas that I am interested in. I will be writing one such post every year. I am excited to see how right or how wrong I am going to be.</i>

1. Data compression and video encoding/decoding will be exciting problems to work upon.
2. Redis is a lovely tool but it will lose it all if its management team isn't replaced.
3. Senior engineers will have to reinvent themselves in ways that they did not anticipate in order to stay relevant.
4. AI holograms, figures or just robots will be able to teach very well and challenge the existing ways of doing "ed-tech".
5. Rust will be the default language for production low-level systems. C will continue to be important for prototyping low-level projects.
