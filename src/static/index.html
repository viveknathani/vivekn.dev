    <h1>hi, I am Vivek</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>I’m an engineer from India who loves creating things.</p>
    <p>
      Currently, I take care of engineering at
      <a href="https://www.marscomputers.tech/">Mars Computers</a> where we are
      trying to make powerful compute accessible everywhere. We are a small team
      of really passionate people, trying to solve some really hard problems,
      while building great digital products, and doing fun low-level
      engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve always been curious about how systems are built. My first full-time
      job sparked an interest in database internals. A networking issue once led
      me down the rabbit hole of understanding DNS. Now, at Mars, I get to
      explore operating systems and hardware—a journey that often takes me
      deeper down the stack. There’s nothing quite as rewarding as understanding
      how systems work, building something beautiful around that understanding,
      and seeing real users benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>Sporadically, I write <a href="/blog">blogs</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Outside of engineering, I’m a math enthusiast and I see myself as a lifelong student of the subject. There
      is something truly intriguing about numbers and how they can be abstract
      and useful in the real world at the same time. Checkout my
      <a href="/math">math</a> section where I share what I am upto in this
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re looking for inspiration, check out my
      <a href="/deepcuts">deepcuts</a> section—it’s where I share books, papers,
      and videos I think are truly worth your time.
