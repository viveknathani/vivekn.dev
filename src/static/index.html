    <h1>hi, I am Vivek</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>I’m an engineer from India who loves creating things.</p>

    <p>
      I’m currently an SDE-II at <a href="https://aigrowth.in">AI Growth</a>,
      where I’m working on new products to expand the company’s investment
      platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before this, I used to take care of engingeering at
      <a href="https://www.marscomputers.tech/">Mars Computers</a>, where we
      built powerful remote machines that felt local. I began my career as a
      backend engineer at Investmint, which was again a financial product. Over
      the years, I’ve been a serial startup engineer - building systems from
      scratch and working across the stack, from dealing with bytes in a shader,
      to dealing with Win32 APIs in Rust to writing APIs in Node and Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve always been curious about how systems are built. A networking issue
      once led me down the rabbit hole of understanding DNS. A bottleneck in my
      database sparked my interest in database internals. I find joy in digging
      deep. There’s nothing quite as rewarding as understanding how systems
      work, building something beautiful around that understanding, and seeing
      real users benefit from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of software, I’m also a math enthusiast. These days, I run a
      <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app/club">math club</a> in Bengaluru,
      India.
    </p>

    <p>Sporadically, I write <a href="/blog">blogs</a>.</p>

    <p>
      If you’re looking for inspiration, check out my
      <a href="/deepcuts">deepcuts</a> section—it’s where I share books, papers,
      and videos that I think are truly worth your time.
