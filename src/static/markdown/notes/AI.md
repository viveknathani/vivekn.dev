1. what is ML? - study of algorithms that learn from data and work well on unseen data without explicit instructions being provided.
2. categories of machine learning algorithms - supervised learning, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, reinforcement learning.
3. supervised learning - algorithms that learn input-to-output mappings (X -> Y). example: spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising.
4. regression - predict a number
5. classification - predict categories
6. unsupervised learning - find patterns in data. example: form clusters like in google news.
7. another form of unsupervised learning is anomaly detection - find unusual data points.
8. yet another form of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction - compress data using fewer numbers.
